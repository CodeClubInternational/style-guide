# Code Club Style Guide

## What is This?

This style guide will provide you with everything you'll need to build your own Code Club website. Inside you'll find information about the layout of pages, the styles of your HTML components, and bigger modules that bring many components together. There's also some guidance about how to use the Code Club brand, and our colour palette.

Each component is provided with usage notes, a visual example and the HTML required to add to your site. Think of these elements as building blocks required to create a Code Club website.

**PLEASE NOTE** that you may only use these styles if you have been given permission from Code Club World Ltd. Any other use is unauthorised.

## How to download the Code Club assets

You'll need to use [Bower](http://bower.io) to include download and include the assets to your site. If you don't already have it installed, head to [the Bower installation guide](http://bower.io/#install-bower) and follow the instructions.

When you have that installed and you're ready to download the Code Club assets package, open a Terminal window, navigate to the root of your site, and run the following command:

`bower install code-club`

That will grab the latest release, and will download it to the default location of `./bower_components/code-club` - this website will assume that the assets are located there in relation to the root of your site.

## Updating the assets

Again, we'll perform this action with Bower. From your site's root directory in Terminal, run this command:

`bower update code-club`

For more help with Bower and its related commands, please see the [documentation on the Bower website](http://bower.io).
