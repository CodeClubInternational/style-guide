<p>
  To help you get started building your pages, we've created a basic HTML document which you'll find in the bower package in
  <code>/bower_components/code-club/dist/html</code>
</p>

<p>
  You should copy the contents of this file to wherever your website handles its templates, and edit it accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  You will need to edit the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Page Title and Country in the <code>title</code> element</li>
  <li>Any additional meta data inside the <code>head</code></li>
  <li>Any additional styles your need to include - <strong>be sure to include these after the code-club.min.css styles</strong></li>
  <li>Your country name in the Code Club logo</li>
  <li>Your website's main navigation links</li>
  <li>The page's content</li>
  <li>Any additional JavaScripts - again, ideally after the code-club.min.js script</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The navigation banner is already set up to alter responsively based on differing screen widths, so you'll automatically have a
  flexible navigation system, but do be aware of overfilling it with too many links. We've tried to make it as accommodating as possible,
  but there's still a finite amount of space to play with. <strong>Be sure to test your website on as many different devices
  as you can!</strong>
</p>
